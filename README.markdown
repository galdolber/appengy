Appengy is an app server that attempts to provide some of what
Google's Appengine does for the large scale, for the small scale.

## Goals
* Support multiple applications, each one with multiple domains
* Zero downtime deploys
* Run multiple versions of an application in parallel
* Automatic file upload handling
* Logs

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials can be found on the [Appengy wiki](http://github.com/galdolber/appengy/wiki).
